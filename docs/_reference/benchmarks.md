## Results

ZapFast used **150 MB of idle RAM**, compared with **1.13 GB for WhatsApp Web
and its Chromium processes**. Both clients were linked to the same account.
These are medians from four paired runs on one Linux desktop, measured on
15 September 2026.

ZapFast 0.16, with in-app video and image previews, animated stickers, and
more of the interface, uses about **200 MB** idle on the same desktop. The
table below is the measured 0.13.1 run.

| Measurement | ZapFast 0.13.1 | WhatsApp Web + Chromium |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Idle RAM, PSS | **150.0 MB** / 143.1 MiB | **1,127.6 MB** / 1,075.4 MiB |
| Process start to first window | **152 ms** | **528 ms** |
| Chat UI observed, approximate* | **0.69 s** | **4.13 s** |

**The chat display took longer on the web.** The distinction between the two
timings matters: a browser window can appear while WhatsApp is still loading.
The first-window measurement uses the same compositor event for both apps.

*The chat-UI observations use different detectors: ZapFast's generic “Chats”
header in a cropped screen capture, and WhatsApp Web's chat pane with at least
one row in the page. Both include detection and window-placement overhead.
They illustrate what we observed; they do not establish a precise multiplier
for time to a fully usable or synchronized conversation.*

## The four runs

Each RAM figure is the median of five idle samples. The headline figures are
the medians of these four runs. MB and GB use decimal units; MiB uses binary
units.

| Run | ZapFast RAM, MiB PSS | Web + Chromium RAM, MiB PSS | ZapFast first window | Chromium first window |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 147.9 | 1,093.1 | 156.0 ms | 526.2 ms |
| 2 | 143.1 | 1,071.8 | 154.1 ms | 516.9 ms |
| 3 | 143.1 | 1,057.3 | 150.3 ms | 548.6 ms |
| 4 | 129.4 | 1,078.9 | 150.8 ms | 529.6 ms |

All completed pairs are included. A fifth pair was interrupted before its
first memory sample and is excluded.

## How we measured

**Machine and software.** AMD Ryzen 5 7500F, 62.4 GiB usable RAM, Arch Linux
7.2.3, and Hyprland. ZapFast was the installed 0.13.1 release, using real
linked chats. Chromium was version 152.0.7977.82, with a dedicated profile,
one WhatsApp Web page, and no installed extensions. The regular browser
profile remained open in the background.

**Launches.** Each tested application was fully stopped before launch. The
linked account, local data, and caches were retained. These were fresh
processes with warm OS caches, rather than starts after a reboot or reopening
from the tray. Application order alternated between pairs. A monotonic timer
started immediately before process creation; a Hyprland IPC listener recorded
the new window's `openwindow` event and checked its process ID.

**Idle state.** Each app showed its chat list in a foreground window sized
1280 × 800 logical pixels. After detecting the chat UI and waiting ten
seconds, we took five memory samples separated by a one-second sleep.

**RAM accounting.** We summed `Pss` from `/proc/PID/smaps_rollup` for the
application's processes. PSS assigns each process its proportional share of
shared pages, so summing it avoids counting those pages repeatedly.
The [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html)
defines the metric. Chromium's total includes its browser, renderers, GPU,
utility, zygote, and crash-handler processes: 14 processes in these runs,
compared with one for ZapFast. Neither app had swapped memory in the samples.

## What the comparison covers

- **One Linux machine and one account.** Local history and caches differ
  between clients. Memory use changes with workload and session length.
  These measurements do not cover macOS or Windows.
- **WhatsApp Web together with its dedicated browser.** We did not measure
  an empty-browser baseline. The numbers do not establish the incremental
  cost of adding a WhatsApp tab to an already-open browser. Shared pages with
  the existing browser profile affect PSS attribution.
- **Resident system RAM.** GPU VRAM and all operating-system or compositor
  overhead are not separately measured.
- **Window appearance and observed chat display.** These are distinct from
  completing message synchronization, connecting to WhatsApp, or sending a
  message. The two chat-UI detectors are not equivalent readiness tests.

The exported data contains only counts, timings, and memory measurements.
It contains no messages, contact names, credentials, QR codes, or screenshots
of private chats.

## Try it

ZapFast is a native WhatsApp client written in Rust for Linux, macOS, and
Windows. On Arch Linux:

```sh
yay -S zapfast-bin
```
