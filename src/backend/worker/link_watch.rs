//! Notice a link that is still open but no longer carries anything.
//!
//! After a suspend, or a network change underneath it, a TCP connection can
//! stay established while nothing arrives, and a write into it can wait
//! forever for buffer space. whatsapp-rust's keepalive sends its ping through
//! that same write, and its answer deadline only starts once the write has
//! finished, so a wedged write silences the keepalive and its dead-socket
//! watchdog alike: no error, no disconnect, no reconnect (issue #177).
//!
//! The worker's tick asks this watch two questions and reconnects through
//! the library when either says so:
//!
//! - Did the machine sleep since the last tick? The wall clock keeps running
//!   through a suspend, while the monotonic clock behind [`Instant`] stops on
//!   Linux (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`) and macOS (`CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW`). On Windows,
//!   `Instant` counts the suspend too, so this question never fires there and
//!   the next one fires on the first tick after any sleep longer than its
//!   limit.
//! - Has nothing at all arrived for longer than a working link allows? The
//!   library pings an idle link every 15 to 30 seconds, so its answers alone
//!   keep the received-frame counter moving.
