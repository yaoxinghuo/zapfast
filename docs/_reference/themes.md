## Where themes live

A theme is a small JSON file in the `themes` folder beside `settings.json`:

| Platform | Themes folder |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `~/.config/zapfast/themes/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/me.paolino.zapfast/themes/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\paolino\zapfast\config\themes\` |

The quickest way there is **Settings → Appearance → Open themes folder**,
which creates the folder if needed. Each file shows up in the Theme picker
under its name: `gruvbox.json` becomes **Gruvbox**.

The built-in palettes (Catppuccin, Nord, Rose Pine, and the others in the
picker) are there too, as ordinary files written the first time ZapFast
starts: read them, change them, or start from one. They are yours after that:
ZapFast never rewrites them, and one you delete stays deleted.

## A first theme

Save this as `themes/gruvbox.json`:

```json
{
  "base": "dark",
  "colors": {
    "window": "#282828",
    "panel": "#1d2021",
    "surface": "#32302f",
    "text": "#ebdbb2",
    "accent": "#b8bb26"
  }
}
```

`base` is `dark` (the default) or `light`. Every colour you leave out comes
from that base, so a theme can be as short as one accent colour. Colours are
`#RRGGBB`, or `#RRGGBBAA` with transparency.

## Colours

| Name | What it colours |
| --- | --- |
| `window` | The window's background |
| `panel` | The chat list and Settings |
| `surface` | Fields, cards, and menus |
| `surface_hover` | A surface under the pointer |
| `surface_active` | The selected chat |
| `outline` | Borders and dividers |
| `text` | Main text |
| `secondary` | Less important text, such as previews and times |
| `dim` | Hints and placeholders |
| `accent` | Buttons, selection, and highlights |
| `accent_hover` | An accent control under the pointer |
| `on_accent` | Text and icons on the accent colour |
| `danger` | Destructive actions and errors |
| `warning` | Warnings |
| `overlay` | Dialogs and floating cards |
| `shadow` | Shadows |
| `chat` | The conversation background, and the **Theme** wallpaper |
| `bubble_in` | Messages from others |
| `bubble_out` | Your messages |
| `link` | Links in messages |
| `read` | The ticks of read messages |

When a theme sets some colours but not the chat ones, ZapFast works them out:
`chat` follows `window`, `bubble_in` follows `surface`, `bubble_out` is
`surface` tinted with `accent`, `link` and `read` follow `accent`, and
`overlay` follows `panel`. That is why Spotifast palettes work as they are.

## Trying it out

On Linux, ZapFast notices a new or changed file by itself. On macOS and
Windows, run `zapfast reload-themes` after saving; it refreshes the list and
the selected theme without restarting, and never opens a stopped app.

A file with a mistake is skipped, and its reason is in the log. ZapFast keeps
the last palette that worked, so a broken or deleted file never resets your
appearance.

On Omarchy, **Follow system** already uses your current Omarchy colours, and
ZapFast follows each theme change as it happens.
